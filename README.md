## Introduction

An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines beaten eggs cooked to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats.

## Ingredients

- 2-3 large eggs
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon of butter or oil
- Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs

## Instructions

1. **Beat the eggs**: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
2. **Heat the pan**: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
3. **Cook the omelette**: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
4. **Add fillings (optional)**: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
5. **Fold and serve**: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
6. **Enjoy**: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
